# Credit Analysis and Prediction

## Problem Statement
Credit companies face challenges in optimizing loan disbursement while minimizing credit risk. To address this, a predictive system is needed to classify loan applicants into two categories:
- Good Loan – Borrowers with a high likelihood of timely repayment
- Bad Loan – Borrowers with a high risk of default

This system enables the company to approve only low-risk loans, thereby reducing potential financial losses and improving the efficiency of credit decision-making.
